# CompanyTM Dashboard

This is a project for Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree. This is just an exercise to get familiar with Angular2 and keep learning.
More info about the project coming soon...

This project is build with Angular2.

## Project requirements

You must develop a corporate dashboard application using a front-end MVC framework of your choosing. The dashboard application must contain a header (with the currently selected dashboard’s name); a menu, allowing the user to navigate between dashboards; and the primary dashboard display area. You should find, or create, your own data files in CSV and JSON formats to provide data to the dashboards. The required dashboards are:

A geospatial view, identifying the number of employees at various company locations.
A “key metrics” view, containing components displaying: the number of open issues, a line chart reflecting number of paying customers over a period of time, and a bar chart reflecting number of reported issues over a period of time.
A “data view” of all issues, with an appearance similar to a spreadsheet, that is sortable and filterable. An issue should contain the following fields:
submission timestamp
customer name
customer email address
description
open/closed status
closed timestamp
employee name
